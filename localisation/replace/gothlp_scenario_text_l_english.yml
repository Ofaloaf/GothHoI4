 GTH_LP_CAMPAIGN_DESC: "The Gothic Communes, more officially known as the Confederation of Workers' Communes or the Comunas Confederats dels Trabalhars, was born out of the Revolution of 1885, overthrowing the Republic of Gothia, which had likewise overthrown the ancient Kingdom of Gothia 22 years earlier. Emerging victorious after the Great War of 1903-1907, the Gothic Communes is now at the apogee of its power- so of course, enemies on all sides are all vying to tear them down."
 GBI_LP_CAMPAIGN_DESC: "The Republic of Britannia was once the nightmare of Europe, violently casting aside its venerable monarchy in a wave of revolutionary bloodshed. Survivng the reaction of the crowned heads of Europe, Britannia's radical regime gradually relaxed into a paragon of liberal democracy. In the 19th century, the Brithenigs created a colonial empire with outposts scattered across the globe. This vast empire, however, was cut down by the Goths following the Great War. Unscupulous politicians in the country have eagerly taken advantage of the national mood to preach revenge against the Communes."
 FRK_LP_CAMPAIGN_DESC: "Dutch-speaking Francïe is the direct descendant of the ancient Frankish realm which had fought the Germanic Goths in the 5th century. Time and time again, Goths and Franks have fought for supremacy in Europe. In 1903, the Franks thought they were poised to delivery the killing blow- and lost. The resulting peace in 1907 was an utter humiliation for the country, destabilizing an already weak government. Fascism quickly took root, and now a generation of disaffected veterans and authoritarian ideologues vow to restore the Frankish state to glory."
 THR_LP_CAMPAIGN_DESC: "Thrace was once a vast republic straddling the Balkans and Middle East. The harsh peace imposed after the Great War in 1907 brought that to a sudden end, fragmenting the republic and leaving a significant Daco-Romanian population scattered beyond the borders of the truncated Thracian state. Vigilia Spirlea, charismatic leader of the fascist Thracian Crusade party, has promoted a 'renewal within' as the solution, calling Thracians across the Balkans to harken back to the 'crusader spirit' which had led Daco-Romanian holy warriors nine hundred years earlier to establish Thrace atop the ruins of a heathen Turkish realm. Whether Spirlea's folk-nationalism will lead Thrace to victory or cause its final destruction is a question still unanswered."
